## 🧭 About Me

I am a technical product manager, protocol designer, and full-stack engineer with:

- **23 years** of software engineering  
- **11 years** of DoD algorithm development (2002–2013)  
- **10 years** of product design  
- **4 years** of UX/UI  
- **5 years** building decentralized apps  
- **17 years** of business development  
- **13 years** of community leadership  
- Founder of **Data Community DC**  
- Director of **Lobby3** and creator of **DeVox**  

I specialize in designing, building, and communicating complex systems — especially decentralized protocols, identity, insurance, provenance, and web3 infrastructure.

I am most effective in small–medium remote teams that value clear specifications, deep technical thinking, and a strong product philosophy.
