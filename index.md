🧭 About Me

I’m a technical product manager and full-stack engineer with:

23 years of software engineering experience

11 years of algorithm development (U.S. DoD)

10 years of product design

4 years of UX/UI development

5 years building decentralized applications

17 years in business development

I specialize in turning complex technical problems into clear roadmaps, specs, and shipped products. My background combines:

Systems-level thinking (DoD algorithms)

Protocol and smart contract design

Frontend and full-stack engineering

Decentralized identity & provenance

User experience and design systems

Leading cross-functional engineering teams

I thrive in async-first, highly technical teams building the infrastructure of the future.

🚀 Featured Projects

Below are a curated set of projects showing my product, protocol, and engineering experience.
All reflect real-world problems, system design, and hands-on full-stack development.

🔐 Pharo — Decentralized Insurance Protocol

Role: Product Lead • Smart Contract Designer • Full-Stack Engineer
Tech: Solidity, TypeScript, Node, React/Next.js

Overview

Pharo is a trust-minimized insurance and risk-pooling system. I designed product logic, contract structure, and claims flows, and built the associated frontend and APIs.

Contributions

Defined product architecture for decentralized risk pools

Created specification documents for claims logic

Designed staking and liquidity flows

Built prototype contracts in Solidity

Developed frontend components for user onboarding

GitHub: (public components to be added)

🪪 SiPPP (Simple Photo Provenance Protocol)

Role: Protocol Designer • Full-Stack Developer • Product & UX
Tech: Python, Node.js, TypeScript, React/Next.js, Cryptographic signatures

Overview

A decentralized photo verification and provenance protocol. It enables creators to sign their photos and verify authenticity without centralized authorities.
